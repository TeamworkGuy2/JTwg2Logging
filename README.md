JTwg2Logging
==============

You want simple info and error logging, you want to get up and running quickly, you want the library you use to follow common conventions so you can easily switch to another framework as your app grows.
This library is designed to meet this stop gap need for a lightweight, relatively simple, logging library that closely follows the default 'java.util.logging' API.
Provides simple message and exception logging to a PrintStream based on a 'java.util.logging.Level'.
